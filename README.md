# Misc-Scripts
A collection of miscellaneous scripts I use for my projects

LookupSpeedTestListDictSet - A comparison of the times a list/dictionary/set/tuple take to query a number.  Proof of O(1) vs. O(N)

primeFunctions - A collection of useful functions for calculating prime numbers, etc.  Used heavily for Project Euler scripts

searchFunctions - Manually coded search functions, for exercise (binary search, etc.)
